# OpenGL game engine with LWJGL3
I'm following the amazing tutorial by [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix) to create an opengl game engine. 
I will use [LWJGL3](https://www.lwjgl.org/) instead of 2.

If you would like follow the tutorial and get help from my code you are welcome to do so, however as I mentioned I will be using a different version of lwjgl and I might add in some extra features or do something of my own.
